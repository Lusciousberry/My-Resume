  <h1>Jennifer Berry</h1>  
  <p><em>Web Development Student</em></p>
  <p>I am currently learning web development. I have a Master's degree in nursing and hold an advanced nursing liscense, however I work part time as an RN at a surgery center. I am looking to branch out from the medical profession. Graduate school and working full time during the pandemic lead to severe burnout. At this time I do not know if I will ever work as an APRN. I am taking this time to learn a new skill that allows me to work more independently from the comfort of my home. This has not been an easy decision because I worked so hard to get where I am. I went in thinking one thing and came out totally different. There is great joy in learning and mastering new skills. Because of this I am not affraid to open new doors of opportunity.</p>
